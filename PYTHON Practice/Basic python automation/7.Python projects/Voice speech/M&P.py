If you seek me, look inside.
Neither with pilgrimages, nor with idols,
Nor with solitude do I abide.
I am not fond of temples or mosques,
In Kaaba or Kailasa, I do not reside.
I have always been with you, my friend.
If you seek me, look inside 
Prayers, invocations, fasts, or rituals,
Everything you can lay aside.
Not over the body, or the soul,
Not over the earth or sky do I preside.
I can’t be found in caves or whirlpools,
Or in the life force allied.
If you sincerely pursue me,
You will find me in a single stride.
Kabir says, “heed my words!”
Just with faith am I gratified.''')
