# ðŸŽ‰ Random Fun & Age Prediction Python Project

Welcome to a playful collection of simple Python scripts that combine APIs, humor, and a bit of age guessing magic!
These scripts are perfect if you're learning how to work with APIs, JSON data, and want to see immediate, fun results in your terminal.




## Features
âœ… Predict a personâ€™s age based on their name using Agify API

âœ… Fetch and display random jokes from public joke APIs

âœ… Interactive script that checks age and then shares a joke accordingly

âœ… Clean, beginner-friendly Python code that demonstrates HTTP requests and JSON parsing


## How it works
âœ¨ Api_basic.py
Takes a hardcoded name ("Rahul") and calls the Agify API to guess the age.

ðŸ˜‚ Random_joke.py
Calls Official Joke API to print a classic setup + punchline joke.

ðŸ§ª Exersise_practise.py

Asks you to enter your name.

Predicts your age.

If your predicted age is 18 or older, fetches a random joke from JokeAPI.

Otherwise, provides an adult joke link for when youâ€™re older.
