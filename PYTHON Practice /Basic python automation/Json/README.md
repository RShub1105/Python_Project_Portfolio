# ðŸ“¦ JSON Utilities & API Integration in Python

This project demonstrates how to work with JSON in Python:  
âœ… Creating JSON from Python dictionaries  
âœ… Saving JSON data to files  
âœ… Loading JSON data from files  
âœ… Fetching data from public APIs and saving responses as JSON  

Itâ€™s a simple, beginner-friendly set of scripts for learning practical JSON handling and HTTP requests in Python.
